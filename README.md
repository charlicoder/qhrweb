## Project README: `qhrweb`

This document outlines the setup and development procedures for the `qhrweb` Next.js application. It is designed to provide a clear and professional guide for developers contributing to or running this project locally.

### Introduction

`qhrweb` is a [briefly describe what qhrweb is, e.g., a web application for managing employee records, a marketing website for a new product, etc.]. Built with Next.js, it leverages modern React features to deliver a performant and scalable user experience.

### Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the local development setup, ensure your environment meets the following requirements:

*   **Git**: For version control and cloning the repository.
*   **Node.js**: Version 20.9 or later is recommended for compatibility with recent Next.js features. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
*   **npm**, **Yarn**, or **pnpm**: A package manager for Node.js. npm is included with Node.js.

### Getting Started

Follow these steps to clone the repository and set up the project locally.

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    Open your terminal or command prompt and execute the following command to clone the `qhrweb` project from GitHub:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:charlicoder/qhrweb.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory**

    Change your current directory to the newly cloned project folder:

    ```bash
    cd qhrweb
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**

    Install all project dependencies using your preferred package manager:

    **Using npm:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    **Using Yarn:**
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

    **Using pnpm:**
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

### Local Development

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server.

1.  **Start the Development Server**

    Run the following command to launch the Next.js development server:

    **Using npm:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    **Using Yarn:**
    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```

    **Using pnpm:**
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```

    This command starts the application in development mode, enabling hot module replacement for faster iteration. The application will typically be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

2.  **Accessing the Application**

    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the running application.

### Development Workflow & Commands

The `package.json` file contains several scripts to aid in the development process:

*   `npm run dev` (or `yarn dev`, `pnpm dev`): Starts the development server with hot-reloading.
*   `npm run build` (or `yarn build`, `pnpm build`): Compiles the application for production.
*   `npm run start` (or `yarn start`, `pnpm start`): Starts the production server after a build.

### Best Practices & Considerations

*   **App Router**: This project likely utilizes the App Router, which is the recommended routing convention in Next.js for new applications due to its support for Server Components and other advanced features.
*   **TypeScript**: If the project is configured with TypeScript, ensure you have the necessary compiler and type definitions installed.
*   **Environment Variables**: Sensitive information (e.g., API keys) should be managed using environment variables (`.env` files) and should not be committed to version control.
*   **Image Optimization**: Utilize the built-in `next/image` component for optimized image loading and performance.
*   **Local HTTPS**: For certain features, running with HTTPS locally might be necessary. Next.js supports this via the `--experimental-https` flag with `next dev`.

### Contributing

For information on how to contribute to this project, please refer to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file (if available) or contact the project maintainers.

### Troubleshooting

*   **Port Conflicts**: If `localhost:3000` is already in use, the development server will typically inform you. You may need to stop the other process or configure Next.js to use a different port.
*   **Dependency Issues**: Ensure your Node.js version is compatible and try deleting `node_modules` and the `.next` cache folder, then running `npm install` again.
*   **Build Errors**: Check the terminal output for specific error messages. Refer to the Next.js documentation for common issues and solutions.
